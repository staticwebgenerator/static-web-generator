# Sample blog post

This blog post shows a few different types of content that’s supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic typography, lists, tables, images, code, and more are all supported as expected.

        <hr>
This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.

## Blockquotes

This is an example blockquote in action:

>  Quoted text goes here.

This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.

### Example lists

This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's a slightly shorter version of the other highly repetitive body text used throughout. This is an example unordered list:


- First list item
- Second list item with a longer description
- Third list item to close it out

And this is an ordered list:

- First list item
- Second list item with a longer description
- Third list item to close it out

And this is a definition list:

<dl>
  <dt>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</dt>
  <dd>The language used to describe and define the content of a Web page</dd>
  <dt>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</dt>
  <dd>Used to describe the appearance of Web content</dd>
  <dt>JavaScript (JS)</dt>
  <dd>The programming language used to build advanced Web sites and applications</dd>
</dl>

## Inline HTML elements
HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">Mozilla Developer Network</a>.

<ul>
          <li><strong>To bold text</strong>, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;strong&gt;</code>.</li>
          <li><em>To italicize text</em>, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;em&gt;</code>.</li>
          <li>Abbreviations, like <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;abbr&gt;</code>, with an optional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> attribute for the full phrase.</li>
          <li>Citations, like <cite>— Mark Otto</cite>, should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;cite&gt;</code>.</li>
          <li><del>Deleted</del> text should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;del&gt;</code> and <ins>inserted</ins> text should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;ins&gt;</code>.</li>
          <li>Superscript <sup>text</sup> uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;sup&gt;</code> and subscript <sub>text</sub> uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;sub&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>

Most of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.
